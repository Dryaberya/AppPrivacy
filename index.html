            <strong>Access to Camera and Local Storage:</strong>
            We require access to your camera and local storage to capture and upload images (such as selfies or other
            images). These images are stored securely on our server and are used exclusively for the app's
            functionality. We do not use these images for any other purpose.

        <li>
            <strong>Access to Location in the Background:</strong>
            To ensure smooth operation, the app collects location data even when it is running in the background.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Permission for Background Running:</strong>
            The app needs to operate in the background to receive updates and signals from the server, even when you are
            using other apps.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Internet Connection Status:</strong>
            The app checks your internet connection status to ensure proper functionality. It notifies you if the
